The goal of the project is to create a C compiler for BESM-6 mainframe.

 * The compiler should be self-hosted, i.e. be able to compile itself.
 * The compiler should be able to build the [Unix v7](https://github.com/besm6/v7besm) kernel.
 * The compiler should integrate natively into [Dubna monitor system](https://github.com/besm6/dubna).
